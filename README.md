# MyConfigsLinux
I'm going to drop here the configuration of my Window Managers and the configuration for some software which I daily use in my laptop. 

My Linux Distro at this time is Wonderful [Arco Linux](https://arcolinux.com/), so, the configurations are based on distro's default ones, I changed them all quite a bit, but the starting point was distro's configuration.

## Tiling Window Managers
From some time ago (let's say 1 year ago), I discovered and tested working with Tiling Window managers. It was a new paradigm to me. A big change with no turn back: I'm sure I don't want to return any more to GNOME or KDE.

I started with Awesome Window Manager, but I didn't like it much, so in a couple of days I started working with I3 Window manager: This one Rocks!!!

Some months later I tested BSPWM. I also like this one, but not as much as I like I3. Anyway, from time to time, I give it a try.

And finally, I'm doing with QTile. A window manager writen in Python wich has come to turn my favorite one using more than one monitor. If I use only one monitor, I can't see any advantages of QTile over I3WM or I3 over QTile. So, both are really good to me.
